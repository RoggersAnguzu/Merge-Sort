# Merge-Sort
Number Sorting Machine.
This C# console application implements a number sorting machine that sorts a given array of numbers using the Merge Sort algorithm. The program ensures user access by requiring a password before allowing input and execution.

How to Use it
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Open the solution in your C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build the solution to resolve dependencies.

Run the program.

You will be prompted to enter a password to access the number sorting machine. The default password is set as "4676".

Upon successful login, the program will prompt you to enter the number of elements to be stored in the array (up to 100).

Enter the numbers one by one as prompted.

The program will display the original numbers in the array.

The program will then apply the Merge Sort algorithm to sort the numbers.

The sorted numbers will be displayed as the final output.

Security
The program employs a password system to ensure only authorized users can access the number sorting machine. The default password is set to "4676," but you can modify it as needed by changing the pass variable in the word() method.
